It is much more stable than [mana](mana) and can therefore be used for permanent spells. Can be stored in crystals and transfered via something like an ATM machine. Certain religions believe it to be part of the soul and reject the concept of transfers. Regenerates very slowly inside people. On death it has a half life of about 1 hour and leaks back into the atmosphere. Can also find mineral deposits. Used for enchanting and other forms of permenant magic.\n"}]}
